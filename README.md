# MMM-MyStandings

MagicMirror module to get ESPN standings for the major US sports.  This is a fork of the original MMM-MyStandings from user vincep5.  It has been updated with the ability to display multiple modules simultaneously and to patch some vulnerabilities.

vincep5 was inspired by MMM-MyScoreboard and figured that this will complement it nicely.
The module will rotate through different sports.  If you only want to show one sport or one division, the module will just display one without rotating.

## Preview

## Installing the module

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/dathbe/MMM-MyStandings
cd MMM-MyStandings
npm install
```

Note: the last dependency of this module is `directory-tree` to check which local logos are available.  If anyone has a better method of checking for local logos and falling back to online logos that doesn't require a dependency, we can get rid of `npm install` entirely!

## Updating the module

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-MyStandings
git pull
npm install
```

## Config

Add `MMM-MyStandings` module to the `modules` array in the `config/config.js` file.

Select the groups you want to rotate through or no groups to rotate through all groups in the league:

- `{ league: "English Premier League" },` will display English Premier League overall standings (because there are no divisions/groups)
- `{ league: "MLB" }` will rotate through all MLB divisions
- `{ league: "NFL", groups: ["AFC East", "AFC North"] },` will rotate between AFC East and AFC North
- `{ league: "NBA", groups: ["Atlantic"] },` will display only the Atlantic Division
